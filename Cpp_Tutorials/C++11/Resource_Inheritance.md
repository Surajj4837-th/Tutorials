## Inheritance

1. The mechanism by which one class acquires the properties of other class.
2. Why inheritance?
   Sometimes we don't have access to existing class' source code. 
   Code reuse.
   New features can also be added to derived class.
   Existing features can also be modified without changing the source code.
   It is not recommended to update a well tested class/program.

3. The class from which the properties are inherited is called as base class.

4. The class which inherits the properties is called as derived class.

5. Functions which are inherited can also be modified in derived class.

6. Constructors and destructors are not inherited.
