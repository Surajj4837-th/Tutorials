## Polymorphism
- It is a concept called as single interface multiple methods.
	Here a single task can be done in multiple ways, not supported by C.

1. Compile Time Polymorphism
   Function and operator overloading are both functions and the function call resolution is done by compiler.
	
	a. Function overloading-

		There can be more than one function with the same name.
		
		How a compiler differentiates between different functions having same names?
		Function definition selection depends on:
		- Number of arguments
		- Type of arguments
		- Same arguments but different order
		- const object invokes const function and non-const object invokes non-const function
		
		Which cases are invalid and create ambiguity for compiler in choosing the function definition?
		- Example 1
				void doSomething();
				void doSomething(int x);
		
			Above declarations not allowed. 
		
		- Example 2
				void doSomething(int x);
				void doSomething(int& x);
		
			Above declarations not allowed.
		
		Why function overloading is not done by considering the change in return type of a function?
		- Because the developer may or may not use the return type.
		Example:
				int sum(int a, int b);
				void sum(int a, int b);
		
		In both the cases, it is not compulsory for the developer to use the returned data. This 
		creates ambiguity for the compiler.

b. Operator Overloading

	int a = 10;
	++a;		//Compiler knows what to do
	
	class Trainee;
	++Trainee;	//Compiler doesn't know what to do
	
	Operator overloading says if an operator with a primitive data type is allowed then it should 
	also be allowed with an user defined data type.
	i.e. if ++a is allowed then ++Trainee should also be allowed.

2. Run Time Polymorphism

   Virtual and pure virtual functions.
