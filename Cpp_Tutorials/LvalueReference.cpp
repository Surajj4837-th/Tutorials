/************************************Summary*****************************************
1. C++ gives the feature to refer already existing variable by an alias.

2. Internally this alias is considered as a constant pointer, whatever happens to the 
   content of alias same happens to the content of variable.

3. Use of alias: When a reference is passed to a function, the operation looks like a 
   pass by value but the changes done to the reference are reflected to the passed 
   parameters.

4. Although it is a pointer, referenceing(&) and dereferncing(*) is done implicitly, 
   it increases code readability.

5. Change in return type in case of returning a reference.

6. One cannot pass a constant value instead of a variable to a function whose parameter
   is a refernce.

7. One cannot assign an expression to a reference.

8. Never return a reference of a local variable as the variable will be destroyed.

9. Do not use the function with refernce as parameter on the left side of the assignment
   operator.

10. For a non-modifiable(const) datatype the reference should also be non-modifiable.

11. If a modifiable datatype is assigned to a non-modifiable reference then the value 
	can be updated using the variable but not using the reference.
