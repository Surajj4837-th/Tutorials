## Error types
1. Compiler errors.
   1. Syntax errors.
   2. Symantic errors: something wrong with the meaning. Example:  
   `a + b;`  
   `int ans = "Hello"/100;`
2. Compiler warnings: The compiler has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem.
3. Linker errors: The linker is having trouble linking all the object files together to create an executable.
4. Runtime errors: errors while execution of code. Examples
   1. Divide by zero.
   2. File not found.
   3. Out of memory.
5. Logical errors: Errors or bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly. These are are mistakes made by the programmer.
