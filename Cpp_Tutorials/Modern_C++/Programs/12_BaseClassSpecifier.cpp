/************************************Summary****************************************
1. In addition to base class pointer we can also use base class references to achieve 
   polymorphism.

2. Useful when we pass objects to functions that expect base class references.

3. The base class references are used instead of base class pointers to take advantage 
   of the references:
   a. We don't have to check for nullptr.
   b. We don't have to use the dereference operator (*).
   c. We don't have to use the address of operator (&) when passing arguments.
   d. Lifetime of references is managed automatically, in contrast to pointers where
      we have to manage memory manually.
