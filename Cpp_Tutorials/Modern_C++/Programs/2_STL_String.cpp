/*******************************************************************************************
1. C style strings are fix in size, C++ strings (std::string) are dynamic in size.

2. These can work with string extraction and insertion operators.

3. Familiar operators can be used (+, = , < , <=, >, >=, +=, ==, !=, [], â€¦)

4. It can be easily converted to C-style Strings if needed for some use cases.

5. C++ strings are always initialized, no garbage values are there in empty declaration.

6. In the C++ string, assignment "=" operator can be used to assign a string to another variable,
   in case of C style string, we will need strcpy() instead.

7. The strcat() in C is used to concatenate strings, in C++ this is replaced by + operator.

8. Two C style strings cannot be concatenated, eg: string str = "hello" + "world";
   However there can be a combination of strings and variable, eg: string str = "hello" + str1 + "world";\

9. at() method to access the string values use bound check.

10. Comparing string operators: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=.
    The objects are compared charachter by charachter lexically.
    Lexicographical comparison, the decision is made as soon as a difference is found between 
    corresponding characters i.e. whole string is not compared.
    A < Z, A < a since capital letters come before lower case in ASCII table.
    These cannot be used in case the comparison is between C style strings, atleast 1 has to
    be C++ style string.

11. Find charachters in string using find() and rfind().

12. Remove charachters using erase() and clear().

13. length() tells the number of charachters in a string.

14. getline() used to take complete input including spaces, cin ignores text after first space.
    There is a 3rd argument in getline which is a limiter, getline will read till the limiter
    in the provided text.
