/************************************Summary*****************************************
1. A Cast operator is an unary operator which forces one data type to be converted into 
   another data type.

2. Static cast - Is is the simplest cast done at compile time. It performs tight type checking.

3. It is possible to convert from any datatype to any other data type but this is illigal.
   To avoid this the static_cast does not allow these kind of castings.

4. Dynamic casting is mainly used for safe downcasting at run time.

5. To work on dynamic_cast there must be one virtual function in the base class. A 
   dynamic_cast works only polymorphic base class because it uses this information to 
   decide safe downcasting. If there is no virtual function then the compiler throws an
   error: “Source type is not polymorphic”.

6. Downcasting: Casting a base class pointer (or reference) to a derived class pointer 
   (or reference) is known as downcasting.

7. Upcasting: Casting a derived class pointer (or reference) to a base class pointer 
   (or reference) is known as upcasting.

8. If dynamic_cast is successful, it returns a value of type new_type.

9. const_cast is used to cast away the constness of variables.

10. const_cast can be used to change non-const class members inside a const member function.

11. const_cast can be used to pass const data to a function that doesn’t receive const.
	
12.	It is fine to modify a value which is not initially declared as const. However 
	updating the variable that is declared as const will lead to undefined behavior.

13. const_cast is considered safer than simple type casting. It’s safer in the sense 
	that the casting won’t happen if the type of cast is not same as original object.

14. const_cast can also be used to cast away volatile attribute.

15. reinterpret_cast is used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of 
	another data type, even if the data types before and after conversion are different.
	It does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not.

16. Reinterpret_cast takes on ly 1 parameter, the source pointer variable and returns 
	nothing. It simply converts the pointer type.

17. reinterpret_cast is a very special and dangerous type of casting operator. And is 
	suggested to use it using proper data type i.e. pointer data type should be same 
	as original data type.

18. reinterpret_cast is used when we want to work with bits.

19. reinterpret_cast creates non-portable codesince some machines use big endian and 
	other use little endian memory storage format.
