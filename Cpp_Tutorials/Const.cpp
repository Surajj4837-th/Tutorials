/************************************Summary*****************************************
1. const variables should be initialized in declaration itself and definition is compulsory.

2. const variables remain constant throughout its life time.

3. The data which remains constant throughout the life of an object can be assigned as
   const variable, example the account number of an object.

4. The data member which is const cannot be initialized in a normal way in a constructor.
   It will be initialized in a constructor definition before start of loop in initializer 
   list. This method of initialization can also be used by non-const members as well.

5. When a function is not expected to change the values of any data member then it 
   should be declared const function.

6. For a const function the keyword 'const' should be used in declaration as well as
   in definition.

7. When an object is declared as const, all its data becomes const automatically.

8. const object can invoke only const member functions because the data is already const
   and a member function is not allowed to change the data of a const object.

9. But in case there is a requirement of updating the value of a data member of a const 
   object, C++ alllows this exception by using a special keyword - mutable.

10. A mutable member function of a const object can be updated.

11. By declaring a function member as static, you make it independent of any particular 
	object of the class. A static member function can be called even if no objects of 
	the class exist and the static functions are accessed using only the class name and 
	the scope resolution operator ::.

12. static member functions can directly access other static members (variables or functions), 
	but not non-static members. This is because non-static members must belong to a class 
	object, and static member functions have no class object to work with.

13. static function of a class is not associated with any class object. So, THIS pointer 
	is not passed to a static function as an internal parameter. So, a static function 
	does not understand THIS pointer inside its body.
