/************************************Summary*****************************************
1. Enum is a collection of named integer constant means it’s each element is assigned 
   by integer value.

2. Two enumerations cannot share the same names.

3. No variable can have a name which is already in some enumeration.

4. Enums are not type-safe. Conventional enums implicitly convert to int, causing logical 
   errors. Comparing two different enums is possible.

5. Class enum doesn’t allow implicit conversion to int, and also doesn’t compare 
   enumerators from different enumerations. It is both strongly typed and strongly scoped.

6. enum type can be specified while declaration:
   enum name : type { enumerator = constexpr , enumerator = constexpr , ... }
