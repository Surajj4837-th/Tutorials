## define # of blocks in a grid:
> int blocksPerGrid = (N * N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

`N * N + threadsPerBlock - 1:

This expression ensures that even if the total number of elements is not evenly divisible by threadsPerBlock, an additional block will be added to cover the remaining elements.
Think of it as rounding up the number of blocks needed. By adding threadsPerBlock - 1, we guarantee that if there is any remainder when dividing the total number of elements by threadsPerBlock, we’ll add one extra block to handle those extra elements.

### Why the + threadsPerBlock - 1?
This is a common technique for "rounding up" when dividing a total number by a group size (in this case, threadsPerBlock):

Without this, the division would round down, possibly leaving some elements unprocessed if the total number of elements is not a perfect multiple of threadsPerBlock.
By adding threadsPerBlock - 1, we ensure that any leftover elements will cause the division to round up, ensuring we have enough blocks to handle all elements.


## What should the block size be in Cuda?
The optimal **block size** in CUDA depends on various factors, such as the nature of your computation, the hardware you're using (specifically the GPU architecture), and the problem you’re trying to solve. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you choose an appropriate block size for your CUDA program.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Warp Size**:
   - A **warp** is a group of 32 threads that are executed simultaneously on a CUDA core. Therefore, the number of threads per block should be a multiple of 32 for efficiency. If you choose a block size that’s not a multiple of 32, some threads might not be fully utilized, leading to underutilization of the GPU.

2. **Occupancy**:
   - **Occupancy** is the ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps that can be run on a multiprocessor of the GPU. While higher occupancy doesn't always guarantee better performance, maximizing occupancy often leads to better resource utilization.
   - To improve occupancy, it's important to balance the number of threads per block with the available resources (like registers, shared memory, and the number of warps per multiprocessor).

3. **Shared Memory**:
   - Each block has its own **shared memory** (a small, high-speed memory). If your algorithm requires a lot of shared memory, the block size should be adjusted to ensure that the total memory used by all blocks does not exceed the available shared memory per multiprocessor.
   - Typically, you might want to keep the block size small enough so that the number of blocks in a multiprocessor doesn’t exceed the available shared memory and register limits.

4. **GPU Architecture**:
   - Different GPU architectures (e.g., Volta, Turing, Ampere) have different limits on the number of threads per block, shared memory per block, and registers per thread. You should consider the architecture you're using to avoid exceeding these limits.
   - For example, on newer GPUs, you might have a **maximum block size of 1024 threads**, but older GPUs may have a lower limit (e.g., 512 threads per block).

### Common Block Sizes:
- **256 threads per block**: This is a commonly used block size because it provides a good balance between the number of threads and the hardware resources. It is often a good starting point for experimentation.
- **512 threads per block**: This is another good choice for many applications. It works well when you want to fully utilize the GPU without overwhelming the shared memory or registers.
- **1024 threads per block**: This is the maximum allowed block size on many GPUs, but it may not always be the best choice. While it uses the maximum number of threads per block, it can cause issues if there are too many active warps or if the shared memory and register limits are exceeded.
  
### General Guidelines for Choosing a Block Size:
1. **Start with 256 or 512 threads per block**.
   - These are reasonable choices that will work well for many algorithms.
2. **Adjust based on the workload**:
   - If you are working with large arrays or matrices and require a significant amount of shared memory, start with smaller block sizes (e.g., 128 or 256 threads per block).
   - For simpler problems or when you need to launch many threads to cover a small dataset, a larger block size (e.g., 512 or 1024 threads) can be appropriate.
3. **Avoid too many threads per block**: 
   - If your block size exceeds the GPU's maximum supported threads per block (typically 1024), it can lead to inefficient use of the hardware.

4. **Try to optimize based on occupancy**:
   - You can use CUDA profiling tools like **NVIDIA Nsight** or **nvprof** to check the occupancy and performance of your application with different block sizes. Profiling can guide you to find the best block size for your specific application.

### Example:
Here’s a simple example of how you might configure a block size in your kernel launch:

```cpp
int threadsPerBlock = 256;  // Start with 256 threads per block
int blocksPerGrid = (N * N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(...);
```

### Final Tip:
- **Experiment**: Block size optimization often requires experimentation. Start with a reasonable default (like 256 or 512) and then adjust based on performance measurements. Profiling is crucial to find the best configuration for your particular GPU and problem.

## How many threads are present in GPU hardware?
The number of threads available in a GPU depends on the architecture of the GPU and how it is configured to execute parallel tasks. The number of threads in a GPU isn't directly specified as a single number, but rather, it is determined by the number of **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**, the number of **cores** within each SM, and the **warp size** (32 threads per warp).

Here’s how to estimate the number of threads a GPU can handle:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**:
   - Modern GPUs have multiple **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**. Each SM can handle many threads concurrently.
   - For example, NVIDIA's **Volta**, **Turing**, and **Ampere** architectures typically have between 40 and 80 SMs, depending on the specific model.
   
2. **Cores per SM**:
   - Each SM contains several **CUDA cores**, typically 64 CUDA cores per SM in most modern NVIDIA GPUs.
   
3. **Warp Size**:
   - A **warp** is the basic unit of scheduling in CUDA. Each warp consists of 32 threads that execute the same instruction simultaneously.
   
4. **Threads per Block**:
   - The threads within each **block** are divided into warps (32 threads per warp).
   - The block size can vary (e.g., 256 or 512 threads), but it’s generally designed to be a multiple of 32 to align with the warp size.

### Estimating the Number of Threads:
To calculate the total number of threads that a GPU can handle at once, we need to consider the number of SMs, cores per SM, and the number of warps per SM.

#### Formula:
1. **Number of threads per SM**:
   - If there are 64 CUDA cores per SM and each thread is assigned to a single core, then each SM can handle many threads concurrently.
   - A typical SM can manage multiple warps. If we assume that the GPU runs one warp (32 threads) at a time per core, the number of threads per SM would be approximately `64 cores * 32 threads per core = 2048 threads per SM`.

2. **Total Threads in the GPU**:
   - For a GPU with `N` SMs, the total number of threads the GPU can manage is:  
     \[
     \text{Total Threads} = N \times 2048
     \]
     where `N` is the number of SMs in the GPU.

### Example Calculation for Specific GPUs:

1. **NVIDIA Tesla V100** (Volta Architecture):
   - **Number of SMs**: 80 SMs
   - **CUDA cores per SM**: 64 CUDA cores
   - **Threads per SM**: 2048 threads (64 cores * 32 threads per core)
   
   **Total threads**:
   \[
   80 \times 2048 = 163,840 \text{ threads}
   \]

2. **NVIDIA RTX 3080** (Ampere Architecture):
   - **Number of SMs**: 68 SMs
   - **CUDA cores per SM**: 128 CUDA cores
   - **Threads per SM**: 4096 threads (128 cores * 32 threads per core)
   
   **Total threads**:
   \[
   68 \times 4096 = 278,528 \text{ threads}
   \]

3. **NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti** (Pascal Architecture):
   - **Number of SMs**: 28 SMs
   - **CUDA cores per SM**: 64 CUDA cores
   - **Threads per SM**: 2048 threads
   
   **Total threads**:
   \[
   28 \times 2048 = 57,344 \text{ threads}
   \]

### Additional Considerations:
- **Thread Scheduling**: GPUs don't have all threads executing simultaneously. The threads are organized into warps and executed in parallel in groups (warps). If there are more warps than can fit in the SM, some warps will be queued and executed when the resources are available.
  
- **Thread Limits**: While you can launch a large number of threads from your CUDA kernel, there are hardware limitations like the **number of threads per block** (often 1024 threads per block on modern GPUs), the **maximum number of blocks per multiprocessor**, and available **shared memory** per block, all of which impact how you structure your kernels.

### Conclusion:
The total number of threads that a GPU can handle depends on the GPU architecture, the number of SMs, and the number of CUDA cores per SM. For example, an **RTX 3080** with **68 SMs** can handle **278,528 threads** concurrently, while a **V100** can handle **163,840 threads**. However, the number of active threads depends on the kernel launch parameters, and actual performance depends on how effectively the threads are utilized.


## What is the limit of the number of threads in a block?
The **limit of the number of threads in a block** in CUDA depends on the **compute capability** of the GPU. The limit is defined by hardware and the CUDA programming model. Below are the key details:

### 1. **Maximum Number of Threads per Block:**
   - For most NVIDIA GPUs, the **maximum number of threads per block** is **1024**. This is the common limit for modern GPUs with **Compute Capability 3.x or higher**.

### 2. **Compute Capability Considerations:**
   - Earlier GPU architectures (Compute Capability 1.x, 2.x) had different limits for threads per block, but since **Compute Capability 3.0** and above, the limit has been set to **1024 threads per block**.
   - The limit of 1024 threads applies regardless of whether you're using **1D**, **2D**, or **3D thread blocks**. However, when you use 2D or 3D blocks, the product of the dimensions must not exceed 1024 threads.

### 3. **Thread Block Dimensions:**
   - For **1D** blocks: You can have up to 1024 threads along one dimension (e.g., `blockDim.x = 1024`).
   - For **2D** blocks: The total number of threads in the block should not exceed 1024. For example, you could have `blockDim.x = 32` and `blockDim.y = 32`, which gives a total of `32 * 32 = 1024` threads per block.
   - For **3D** blocks: Similarly, the product of `blockDim.x * blockDim.y * blockDim.z` should not exceed 1024 threads. For instance, you could have `blockDim.x = 8`, `blockDim.y = 8`, and `blockDim.z = 16`, which gives a total of `8 * 8 * 16 = 1024` threads per block.

### 4. **Maximum Threads per Multiprocessor:**
   - Each **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)** on a GPU can handle a limited number of threads simultaneously. For example, GPUs with **Compute Capability 3.0** or higher typically have a limit of **2048 threads per SM**.
   - The number of blocks per SM is also limited, and the total number of active threads across all blocks running on an SM is constrained by the **maximum number of threads** the SM can support.

### 5. **Block Size and Performance Considerations:**
   - While the maximum is 1024 threads per block, choosing a **smaller block size** can sometimes lead to better performance, as it may lead to better occupancy and more efficient use of the GPU's resources.
   - It's also essential to ensure that the **shared memory** and **registers** required by the block fit within the limits of the SM. Too large a block may cause inefficient memory usage, leading to lower performance.

### Example:
For a **3D block configuration** where `blockDim.x = 8`, `blockDim.y = 8`, and `blockDim.z = 16`:

- Total threads in the block = `8 * 8 * 16 = 1024` threads, which is within the limit.

### 6. **Summary of Thread Limits:**

| **Compute Capability** | **Max Threads per Block** | **Max Threads per SM** |
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **1.x/2.x**             | 512                       | Varies by GPU          |
| **3.x and above**       | 1024                      | 2048                   |

#### To Conclude:
- The **maximum number of threads per block** is typically **1024** for most modern GPUs (compute capability 3.0 and above).
- You must ensure that the product of block dimensions (for 2D or 3D) does not exceed this limit (1024).
- The **block size** you choose should align with the resources available (e.g., threads, registers, shared memory) to ensure optimal GPU performance.
